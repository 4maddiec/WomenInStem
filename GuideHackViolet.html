<h1 style="background-color: #c935e2; color: white;"> Women's Guide to Life, Liberty and The Pursuit of Happieness</h1>
<p> Any girl can slay their own way, but this is our guide if you want to sit at our lunch table</p>

<p> When discussing how to start a page to a guide to women there was no other choice but to use the iconic moment of sisterhood when the Schuyler sisters 
turning down Aaron Burr and talking about how women should be included in the constituion. As a poly sci minor they have my seal of approval, especially because I went through a pretty hardcore Hamilton phase </p>
<img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\Barbie.jpg" alt="margot robbie">
<p> The Barbie movie is perfection. Even the critics were anti-feminist, saying that Ryan Gossling was too old to play Ken, a remark that is usually targeted at actresses. 
Barbie learned what womanhood was truly about, the pain, the happiness, the unequal expectations.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\TayTay.jpg" alt="tay tay" width="700px" height="500px">
<p> Tay Tay, T Swizle, Taylor Swift. She's a queen, an icon, a legend. She advocates for womens rights and even wrote a song about the uneven gender roles
in the music/celebrity industry. Safe to say we stan Tay Tay </p>

<p> Girlie pop revolutionized the world of female empowerment. After her boyfriend said she wasn't "smart enough" to go to law school, queen got in to Harvard, fucking Harvard.
She then went on to girl boss her way to the same super competitive internship as her ex. Then she went on to defend another girlie pop who was on trial and won the case becuase of
her extensive knowledge on fashion, showing that traditionally feminine things are actually helpful. She also slays her pantsuits, like I aspire to look as good as she does.</p>

<p> I mean what can I say but look at thier adorable little faces, and thier eyes, and their ears, omg they are just perfection. I love them so much, they are so pretty. I miss my puppers 
I want to snuggle their little faces all day</p>

<p> As a drink monster myself I am always down for starbies. Although I prefer a triple star day or a buy one get one day, I don't think I can turn down a good latte. I put Stanley
here to becuase drink monsters need variety, and you got to hydrate or diedrate and I choose to hydrate. </p>
<img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\Notes.jpg" alt = "notes app">
<p> You may be thinking, the notes app? But this app is worshiped by women. You need a shopping list, put it here, you want to track something, put it here, need a reminder, put it here
and my personal favorite, the baby name list. This iconic list is for sure on almost every women in the worlds phone. Like if you don't have this note, how the hell you gonna name your kids honey</p>
<img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\Diana.jpg" alt = "Princess Diana">
<p> This list would be incomplete without Princess D. She was the peoples princess. She showed compassion to people suffering from AIDS at the height of the AIDS epidemic. 
She broke royal rules that were targeted against women, to be a good mother to her children. She is my roman empire. </p>
<img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\Pride.jpg" alt = "Pride and Prejudice">
<p> Rejection. Love. Feminism before Feminism was a thing. Jane Austen wrote a book with all three of these. She had the main character reject a propsal, in the old times, 
like the real old times not like the 1980s, that shit was unheard of. She then fell in love with the Darcy, like ok you do you girl.</p>
