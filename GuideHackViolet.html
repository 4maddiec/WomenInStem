<div style = "padding:20px;">
<p style = "text-align:center; font-size:30px;"> When discussing how to start a page to a guide to women there was no other choice but to use the iconic moment of sisterhood when the Schuyler sisters 
turning down Aaron Burr and talking about how women should be included in the constituion. As a poly sci minor they have my seal of approval, especially because I went through a pretty hardcore Hamilton phase </p>

<p style = "text-align:center; font-size:30px;"> The Barbie movie is perfection. Even the critics were anti-feminist, saying that Ryan Gossling was too old to play Ken, a remark that is usually targeted at actresses. 
Barbie learned what womanhood was truly about, the pain, the happiness, the unequal expectations.</p>

<p style = "text-align:center; font-size:30px;"> Tay Tay, T Swizle, Taylor Swift. She's a queen, an icon, a legend. She advocates for womens rights and even wrote a song about the uneven gender roles
in the music/celebrity industry. Safe to say we stan Tay Tay </p>

<p style = "text-align:center; font-size:30px;"> Girlie pop revolutionized the world of female empowerment. After her boyfriend said she wasn't "smart enough" to go to law school, queen got in to Harvard, fucking Harvard.
She then went on to girl boss her way to the same super competitive internship as her ex. Then she went on to defend another girlie pop who was on trial and won the case becuase of
her extensive knowledge on fashion, showing that traditionally feminine things are actually helpful. She also slays her pantsuits, like I aspire to look as good as she does.</p>

I want to snuggle its little face all day. Puppies make my baby fever become reasonable by bringing out the maternal side of women but without the need for kids, becuase
not all women need kids, my job in life isn't mother. </p>

<p  style = "text-align:center; font-size:30px;"> You may be thinking, the notes app? But this app is worshiped by women. You need a shopping list, put it here, you want to track something, put it here, need a reminder, put it here
and my personal favorite, the baby name list. This iconic list is for sure on almost every women in the worlds phone. Like if you don't have this note, how the hell you gonna name your kids honey</p>

<p  style = "text-align:center; font-size:30px;"> This list would be incomplete without Princess D. She was the peoples princess. She showed compassion to people suffering from AIDS at the height of the AIDS epidemic. 
She broke royal rules that were targeted against women, to be a good mother to her children. She is my roman empire. </p>

like the real old times not like the 1980s, that shit was unheard of. She then fell in love with the Darcy, like ok you do you girl.</p>

<p style = "text-align:center; font-size:30px;"> The original bad bitch was Rosie the Riveter. This queen was an icon for women to join the work force during World War 2. Girlie pop said we can do it, and we fucking can. 
She is also a fashion icon with her handkerchief hairdo, like girl is popping off. </p>

<p style = "text-align:center; font-size:30px;"> I know it may seem like a lot of fun pictures with wildly comical captions, ik ik I'm funny, but there is a real reason for this guide. Many of the things and people women
like are seen as bad and cringy. Like recently, women enjoying football becuase of Taylor Swift has been seen as bad and there has been a lot of hate. Though it may not seem like it,
this is a type of misogyny, as women cannot like anything without having to feel bad about it. You like One Direction, you are a crazy fan girl, you like Starbucks, you are wasting your money,
as if someone else should care about how you spend YOUR money.</p>
