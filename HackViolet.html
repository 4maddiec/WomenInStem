<h1 style="background-color: #c935e2; color: white;"> The Past and Present of Girl Bosses in Computing </h1>

<p>The history of women in computers and my takes on them </p>


<h2> Ada Lovelace <h2>
<h3> Our lord and savior, queen of code<h3>
     <img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\ada 2.jpg" alt="Ada Lovelace, one of the most beautiful, intelligent women to exsit" width="500px" height="500px">
<p> Ada Lovelace was an English mathmatician, and is credited with being the worlds first computer programmer (slay). She worked on Babbage's Analytical Engine,
and her work was so exemplary that she even has a coding language named after her.</p>
<p> Ella's opinon: Ada is an inspriation to all women in computing, as she not only paved the way for women in the field, but for the field in general. Her work was not defined by her
gender, but for her intelligence, which is why she is my roman empire, slay queen.</p>
<h2> Grace Hopper<h2>
<h3> The Badass<h3>

<img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\GraceHopperPretty.jpg" alt="Grace Hopper in her youth" width ="400px" height = "500px">
<p>Grace Hopper was a pioneer of computer programming. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages. 
She got her Ph.D from Yale in mathematics and mathematical physics. She served 43 years in the Navy earning multiple awards, all while innovating the world of computer science by working on a compiler that converted English terms into machine code. In addition to her already extraordinary resume, she was a professor of Mathematics at Vassar,
 which at the time was an all-female college, so she was empowering the world of women, not just through her accomplishments, but also through inspiring the next generation.</p>
 <p> Ella's opinon: Grace passes the vibe check. Girlie pop was a strong independent woman, and slayed the day away. She was paving the way for women in the Navy and in computers, like queen, your 
 doing to much, but in a good way yk?</p>
 <h2> Hedy Lamarr <h2>
 <h3> The Star <h3>
 <img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\Hedy.jpg" alt="To say Hedy Lamarr looks stunning in this picture is an understatement"width="400px" height="500px" >
 <p>Where to start with an icon such as Hedy Lamarr. With an impressive acting, she earned her self a star on the Hollywood walk of fame. Aside from her star, 
 she also was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame. This queen co-invented a 
 radio guidance system that used a spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the threat of radio jamming from the Axis powers, and probably saving countless lives.</p>
 <p>Ella’s opinion: Not only is Hedy the main character in her acting career, but sis was a legendary inventor, 
 like queens making the rest of us look bad. Hedy is a perfect representation of modern feminism, having the ability to work in technology and the arts, and slaying in both, 
 showing that women don't have to be defined to the jobs that they are traditionally assigned, but they also don't have to stray from those jobs if they choose. </p>
 <h2> Annie Easley <h2>
 <h3> The Human Computer <h3>
 <img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\Annie.jpg" alt="Annie Easley, looking slay in front of an old time computer "width="700px" height="500px" >
 <p>Annie Easley worked as a human computer for NASA. She self taught herself assembly programming and worked in developing code 
 that was used for analyzing alternative power techniques which would be used in hybrid vehicles. </p>
 <p>Ella’s opinion: Annie was a space baddie. She not only broke through the glass ceiling being a woman, but broke through the 
 color barrier being a woman in stem, like dang gurl pop off.  Queen also was the first president of the NASA ski club. She 
 also took it upon herself to tutor students, aka the future of America. As someone who works with kids, I find it very difficult to teach kids important skills such as coding, 
 but girlie managed.</p>
 <h2> Radia Pearlman <h2>
 <h3> Our Mother <h3>
  <img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\Radia.jpg" alt="Radia earning a sick ass medal">
  <p>Radia Pearlman was a major figure in assembling the network known as the internet (hey that's what we’re using now). She is most famous for developing the Spanning Tree Protocol which is fundamental to bridge 
  operation, giving her the nickname “mother of the internet”. Radia is in the National Inventors Hall of Fame and the Internet Hall of Fame, and earning many other notable awards.</p>
  <p>Ella’s opinion: Radia was a girl boss to say the least. She helped make the internet, like that little thing that revolutionized the world, but is like totally chill about it, we love a humble queen. Although 
  she grew up in New Jersey, which is like a big yikes, she was able to realize how awful of a place it was and went to undergrad at MIT which is a glow up to say the least. </p>
  <h2> Steve Shirley <h2>
  <h3> The Heart of Gold <h3>
    <img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\Steve.jpg" alt="Steve smiling like the sweet old lady she is" width="850px" height="500px">
	<p>Steve Shirley was born in Germany, but had to escape because of the Nazi regime. With six pounds of capital Steve founded a
	software company called Freelance Programmers, which created job opportunities for women in computing, inspired by all the sexism she experienced in her previous work. She also
	works a lot with kids on the spectrum and created a foundation dedicated to strengthening research for kids with
	autism and founding schools for kids with autism. She has donated over 67 million pounds of her own personal wealth to charity. </p>
	<p>Ella’s opinion: Girlie pop’s life is a movie like damn. She escaped from Nazi Germany, faced so much sexism in the workplace that she worked to create
	her own foundation to support women in computing, and then spent millions of dollars supporting people on the spectrum. Like low-key she is an amazing person 
	with a heart of gold.</p>
