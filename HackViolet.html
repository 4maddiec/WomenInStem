<h1 style="background-color: purple; color: white;">History</h1>

<p>The history of women in computers (the ones who made it not the ones who are trapped), and my takes on them </p>


<h2> Ada Lovelace <h2>
<h3> Our lord and savior, queen of code<h3>
     <img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\ada 2.jpg" alt="Ada Lovelace, one of the most beautiful, intelligent women to exsit" width="500px" height="500px">
<p> Ada Lovelace was an English mathmatician, and is credited with being the worlds first computer programmer (slay). She worked on Babbage's Analytical Engine,
and her work was so exemplary that she even has a coding language named after her.</p>
<p> Ella's opinon: Ada is an inspriation to all women in computing, as she not only paved the way for women in the field, but for the field in general. Her work was not defined by her
gender, but for her intelligence, which is why she is my roman empire, slay queen.</p>
<h2> Grace Hopper<h2>
<h3> The Badass<h3>

<p>Grace Hopper was a pioneer of computer programming. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages. 
She got her Ph.D from Yale in mathematics and mathematical physics. She served 43 years in the Navy earning multiple awards, all while innovating the world of computer science by working on a compiler that converted English terms into machine code. In addition to her already extraordinary resume, she was a professor of Mathematics at Vassar,
 which at the time was an all-female college, so she was empowering the world of women, not just through her accomplishments, but also through inspiring the next generation.</p>
 <p> Ella's opinon: Grace passes the vibe check. Girlie pop was a strong independent woman, and slayed the day away. She was paving the way for women in the Navy and in computers, like queen, your 
 doing to much, but in a good way yk?</p>
 <h2> Hedy Lamarr <h2>
 <h3> The Star <h3>
 <img src="C:\Users\ellae\OneDrive\Desktop\HackViolet\Hedy.jpg" alt="To say Hedy Lamarr looks stunning in this picture is an understatement"width="400px" height="500px" >
 <p>Where to start with an icon such as Hedy Lamarr. With an impressive acting, she earned her self a star on the Hollywood walk of fame. Aside from her star, 
 she also was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame. This queen co-invented a 
 radio guidance system that used a spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the threat of radio jamming from the Axis powers, and probably saving countless lives.</p>
 <p>Ellaâ€™s opinion: Not only is Hedy the main character in her acting career, but sis was a legendary inventor, 
 like queens making the rest of us look bad. Hedy is a perfect representation of modern feminism, having the ability to work in technology and the arts, and slaying in both, 
 showing that women don't have to be defined to the jobs that they are traditionally assigned, but they also don't have to stray from those jobs if they choose. </p>
